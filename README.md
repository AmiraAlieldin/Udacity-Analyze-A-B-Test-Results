## Project Overview: Analyze A/B Test Results <a name="project_overview"></a>

A/B tests are a common and essential practice for data analysts and data scientists. Gaining hands-on experience with these tests is crucial for developing your skills in handling their complexities.

For this project, you will analyze the results of an A/B test conducted by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page aimed at increasing the number of users who "convert" â€“ that is, the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your objective is to work through this notebook to assist the company in determining whether they should implement the new page, retain the old page, or extend the duration of the experiment to make a more informed decision.

You will be provided with a dataset containing data collected from the experiment. Using statistical techniques, you will answer questions about the data and present your conclusions and recommendations in a comprehensive report.
